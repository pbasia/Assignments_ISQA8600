* Initializing the ggplot2 library in R-studio and loading the data from "HFS Service Data.csv" file to a dataframe named "AssnDE107":  Here I am replacing the empty cell values with NA for data cleaning purpose.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
AssnDE107 <- read.csv("HFS Service Data.csv", na.strings = "")
```
  
* To Understand the data columns, count of their unique values in each column and count of NA values for each variable, I have used the below codes:
```r
rapply(AssnDE107,function(x)length(unique(x)))
```

1. **One scatter plot with three variables, properly labeled; choose your representation of the third variable based on whatâ€™s best for representing the data.**  
* Three used variables are:
  * age  
  * program_unit_description  
  * Adding a third variable in geom point using colour=program_name 
```r
ggplot(data = AssnDE107, aes(x =age , y =program_unit_description , colour=program_name)) +geom_point(size = 3)+
     labs(title = "Scatter plot with three variables", y = "Unit Description of the Program", x = "Age")
```

The above scatter plot is composed of three variables: age, program_unit description and program_name. from this plot , we can say that people have mostly participated in the mental health program. The second major program is for the substance use program. The plot also describes that clients between Age 15 to 55 are most likely  to be treated in the programs.

<br> </br>2. **One faceted plot of two variables, properly labeled.**  
* Two used variables are:
  * age  
  * program_name   
```r
ggplot(data = AssnDE107, aes(program_name,age)) +
 geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
   labs(title = "Faceted plot of two variables Age vs Program Name", y = "Age", x = "Name of Program") +
    facet_wrap(.~ethnic_identity)
```
| ![Faceted Plot](https://github.com/pbasia/Assignments_ISQA8600/blob/main/Data%20Exploration/2FacetedPlot.png)<!-- -->
| -
We have divided the plot using the ethnic_identity of the clients. This plot uses two variables Age and Program Name. We can say from the plot that due to uncollected data or unknown/missing values there are more separations in the plot. However , with the data in hand, the created plot shows the differences of programs being served to the different aged groups accross various ethnicity.

<br> </br>3. **One bar chart, properly labeled.**  
* Used variable is:
  * age    
```r
ggplot(data = AssnDE107)+
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=age),colour="white",fill="blue")+
    labs(title = "One bar chart of Age", y = "Count of Clients of this Age", x = "Age of client")
```
| ![Bar Chart](https://github.com/pbasia/Assignments_ISQA8600/blob/main/Data%20Exploration/3BarChart.png)<!-- -->
| -
This Bar chart is composed of only the Age of the Clients of the HFS. It shows how many clients are in which age group. The charts shows that most clients of HFS are Teens and persons in their mid 30's. Also we can observe that there is a drop in the chart for people in their early 20's and avove 45's.
